      <description>It was about time.
 I created this website back in 2017 when I was fresh out of university. I published a few posts, but most of them were too academical, badly written, and not very interesting to be honest.
 I decided that it was time for a clean-up. I don&amp;#39;t know whether I will ever publish anything here.</description>
