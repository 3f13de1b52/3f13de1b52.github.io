  <h2>Summary of the First Part</h2>

<p>In the first part of this article, I concluded that the main reason why good programmers write bad code is not due to technical issues but because of organizational problems on different levels. The emphasis here is on &ldquo;good programmers&rdquo;, meaning that lack of experience or skill is out of question. Bad code is defined roughly as (quoting from the first part)
<ol type="a">
    <li>non-functional or partially functional code,</li>
    <li>unmaintainable code,</li>
    <li>unreadable code, or</li>
    <li>any combination of these</li>
</ol>
I concluded that since we are talking about competent and experienced programmers, the problems are not of technical nature, but occur due to organizational or management problems. The organizational issues which cause these different kinds of bad code can originate from company/management level or from the development team itself. Issues like human resource planning and undue pressure belong to the former category, whereas documentation complexity and organically grown processes belong to the latter one.</p>

<h2>Solving the Problems</h2>

<h3>Human Resource Planning</h3>

<p>This problem can be summarized with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" rel="noopener" target="blank">bus (or truck) factor</a>. The main question concerning the bus factor is &ldquo;how many team members can get hit by a bus before the project is stalled&rdquo;. For example, in a study done by <a href="https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1233v3" rel="noopener" target="blank">Avelino G, Valente MT, Hora A. (2017) &ldquo;What is the Truck Factor of popular GitHub applications? A first assessment.&rdquo;</a> (important: not peer-reviewed, methodology used may not be completely solid), the authors come to the conclusion that among the GitHub projects that they studied, they found out that 34% of the projects had a bus factor of 1 (meaning losing a single member would stall the project team) such as <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3" rel="noopener" target="blank">D3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/less/less.js/" rel="noopener" target="blank">LESS.JS</a>, and 30% of the projects had a bus factor of 2 such as <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure" rel="noopener" target="blank">CLOJURE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty" rel="noopener" target="blank">NETTY</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber" rel="noopener" target="blank">CUCUMBER</a>. In comparison, projects like <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux" rel="noopener" target="blank">LINUX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew" rel="noopener" target="blank">HOMEBREW</a> had a bus factor of 130 and 250 respectively.</p>

<p>Lavallée &amp; Robillard (2015) suggest knowledge sharing methods like pair programming and code reviews in order to spread the specialized knowledge in the team among its members. What they don&rsquo;t seem to mention is the fact that there are various roles in a development team given a certain production cycle. Even if the knowledge required is spread among the team members evenly, the project can get stalled or heavily delayed simply because there aren&rsquo;t enough members to fill all of the required roles. In any case, keeping the bus factor high in a team would result in a healthier development environment.</p>

<h3>Undue Pressure</h3>

<p>This is a very tricky problem to tackle. The reason why undue pressure happens is because someone from higher management &ndash; who is probably misinformed about the project &ndash; puts time related pressure on the development team. The speed of programming is more or less constant, with a somewhat increase overtime due to experience of the team. If someone puts an unrealistic deadline on the project, code quality has to suffer due to it.</p>

<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way around it other than informing the higher management about the risks about putting pressure on the team. As Lavallée &amp; Robillard (2015) puts it, higher management is rarely interested in code quality. It might prove to be useful to educate them about technical debt and its risks on the long term. This, however, is not going to be successful against a higher management only thinking about short-term goals.</p>

<h3>Documenting Complexity</h3>

<p>According to Lavallée &amp; Robillard (2015) documentation boils down to two main questions, namely what a certain piece of code does and why it exists. It is common knowledge that lack of documentation is one of the hallmarks of bad projects. With lack of documentation,  I do not only refer to the lack of documentation as a separate entity on its own, but also to unreadable and cryptic code, or simply to code which is difficult to follow. If a documentation exists at all, another challenge arises: Keeping the documentation up-to-date, since code seldom remains the same for a long period of time.</p>

<p>This problem can be solved by a) encouraging a documentation culture throughout the project, b) enforcing code quality standards throughout the project, for example through code reviews, and c) generating documentation from code itself and removing the necessity to write separate documentation. There are many examples for this, like <a href="https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc" target="blank" rel="noopener">Compodoc</a> for Angular projects.</p>

<h3>Organically Grown Processes</h3>

<p>This refers to processes which are completely specific to one project and don&rsquo;t fit into the patterns used by the company. This might theoretically range from different naming conventions than the rest of the company to completely different build processes, dependencies, or architectural patterns. These processes do not only cause issues because they differ from rest of the company, but also because they are usually hastily prepared without proper documentation, vision, and/or plan. Often, they are simply makeshift solutions. The problem with organically grown processes can be solved with proper oversight over projects and a shift in development culture.</p>
